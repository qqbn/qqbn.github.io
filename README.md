# My Portfolio 🌐

## Overview 👾

Welcome to the repository for **My Portfolio** project! This project is a showcase of my skills and work, created with modern web technologies. Complete list below:

## Technologies Used ⚙️ 

### 1. [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) 🧑‍🚀
Webstite is build 100% in Astro. Astro is a modern framework for building fast, static websites with a highly optimized, minimal JavaScript approach.

### 2. [Glide.js](https://glidejs.com/) 🧭
Glide.js is a simple, lightweight, and responsive JavaScript slider library that allows you to create smooth and customizable carousels and sliders. I used it to display known technologies.

### 3. [AOS (Animate on Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) 💫
AOS is a small, performance-friendly JavaScript library that enables animations on scroll. I used AOS for scroll animations.

### 4. [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e/) 🎨
To generate unique images for this portfolio, I used DALL-E 3, a powerful image generation model developed by OpenAI.

### 5. [Spline.design](https://spline.design/)🎨
Spline.design is a powerful 3D design tool that was used to create background animation for the website.
